## About This Project 
This project represents a way to build a Directed Graph,  to run algorithms on it and to see the results in an advanced GUI class.


----------


## The Graph And Its Methods

The graph implemented in this project is a directed graph.
The graph has a set of nodes (vertixes) and edges.
 

> **Methods On A Graph:**

 - **Add/Remove Node**: to add/remove a node to the graph.
 - **Add/Remove Edge **: to add/remove an edge from the graph.
 - **Copy**: to get a deep copy of the graph.
 - **Equals**:  to check if to graphs are equal.
 
 **And much more.**


----------
##Algorithms On A Graph
 - **Is Connected**: returns  true if and only if (iff) there is a valid path from EVREY node to each other node.
 - **Shortest Path Destination**: returns the length of the shortest path between suorce node  to destination node.
 - **TSP**:  computes a relatively short path which visit each node in the targets List.
 Note: this is NOT the classical traveling salesman problem, 
 as you can visit a node more than once, and there is no need to return to source node. just a simple path going over all nodes in the list. 
 - **Save**: to save the graph to your pc.
 - **Init**: to load a graph from a file in your pc.
 
  **And more.**


    


----------
GUI
===============
This project contains an advanced GUI class, which can run the algorithms above on a selected graph. it is really usuful for understanding the results of the algorithms.
 In addition it is extremly useful for debugging purposes.
